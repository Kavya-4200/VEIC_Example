# VEIC_Example
I had to make web application using MVC framework (Razor) and with MySQL as database.I had created a web application which performs CRUD operations.
Then had to show Persistence in databases refers to the ways in which processes or objects can continue on, or remain, even when systems are shut down.
There is another web application which shows LINQ queries. Also provided all the validation and testing unit in the system itself.
